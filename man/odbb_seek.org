#+TITLE: odbb_seek - set the descriptor's cursor in the database.

* Synopsis
#+BEGIN_SRC c
#include <oidadb/oidadb.h>

odb_err odbb_seek(odb_desc *desc, odb_bid block);
#+END_SRC

* Description

This function sets the descriptor's cursor to the block that will be
the start of the next call to ~odbb_checkout~ or ~odbb_commit~.

Note that, as stated in previous chapters, OidaDB operates inside of a
file. And if you seek to a position beyond the current size of the
file, then this call will still return successfully. Only when you
call ~odbb_checkout~ or ~odbb_commit~ will the file size be modified
to match the cursor's position along with any blocks that are needed
to fulfill the call.


* Threading

Not thread safe per-buffer.

* Errors

None.
