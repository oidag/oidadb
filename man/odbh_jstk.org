#+TITLE: odbh_jstk - create/destroy structures

* Synopsis

#+BEGIN_SRC c
#include <oidadb/oidadb.h>

struct odbh_jobret odbh_jstk_create(odbh *handle, struct odb_structstat structstat);
struct odbh_jobret odbh_jstk_free(odbh *handle, odb_sid sid));
#+END_SRC

* Description

=odbh_jstk_create= creates a new structure and =odbh_jstk_free= will
free structure space provided that nothing is using that structure.

=structstat.confv= can be null/uninitialize so long that
=structstat.confc= is 0. Otherwise, the =confc= must point to the
bytes available at address of =confv=.

TODO: document structure size.

** Returns

For =odbh_jstk_create=: so long that =.err= is 0, =.sid= will be set.

* Errors

 - =ODB_EINVAL= - =handle= was null
 - =ODB_EINVAL= - =structstat.fixedc= was not at least 4 bytes.
 - =ODB_EINVAL= - =structstat.dynmc=, =structstat.fixedc=, or
   =structstat.confc= is too large (did you initialize them?)
 - =ODB_EPIPE= - The stream was unexpectedly - but deliberately -
   broken by the host.
 - =ODB_EVERSION= - The host does not support this command and uses a
   different library version.
 - =ODB_ENOSPACE= - Cannot allocate: not enough space in database.
 - =ODB_EDELETED= - (=odbh_jstk_free=) already deleted.
 - =ODB_EEXIST= - (=odbh_jstk_free=) structure currently in use.
 - =ODB_ENOENT= - (=odbh_jstk_free=) =sid= is not a valid structure id
 - =ODB_ECRIT=
