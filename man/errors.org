#+TITLE: Errors of OidaDB

* =odb_err=
Nearly all functions in OidaDB will return an *=odb_err=*. If this is not 0
then this indicates an error has ocoured. The exact nature of the value
depends on the function.

=odb_err= itself represents an enum of very general errors. Again,
their exact practical purpose depends on which function returned them.

With the exception of EDB_CRITICAL. This will mean the same thing
every time.
