* Routines
You will see that some [[./odbh_jobdesc_t][jobs]] in OidaDB take in an argument of "Routine
ID". When you see this, it is refering to which functionaility to use
to perform certain algorethmic tasks.

* Predefined Routines


* Installing additional routines

It should be noted, that additional routines installed this way will
be treated the exact same as the predefined routines. The only
difference is that predefined routines come pre-installed. Be assured
that if your custom routine performs poorly compared to a predefined
oue, this is exclusively your fault.
