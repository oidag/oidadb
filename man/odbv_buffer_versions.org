#+TITLE: odbv_buffer_map, odbv_buffer_unmap - map buffer memory to user memory

* Synopsis
#+BEGIN_SRC c
#include <oidadb/oidadb.h>

odb_err odbv_buffer_versions(odb_buf *buffer, odb_ver **o_versionv)
#+END_SRC

* Description

This function simply returns a pointer (via ~o_versionv~) that points
to an array of versions that are associative to the blocks that were
copied into the buffer via [[./odbb_checkout.org][~odbb_checkout~]]. This array is owned by the
buffer so don't try to free it or anything freaky like that.

You can set the versions to be whatever you want via this array, these
will be the versions that are used when committing. But mind you, the
only time you should be setting these versions is when merging
conflicts (when [[./odbb_commit.org][~odbb_commit~]] returns ODB_EVERSION).


* Threading

Not thread safe per-buffer.

* Errors

None.
