#+TITLE: OidaDB Elements

* The Fundementals of every OidaDB Database
The word *Elements* refers to the concepts that every programmer and
administrator should know about OidaDB before they can call themselves
adequate users of the technology.

The vocabulary that symbolizses these elements will be capitalized
throughout this manual to reduce confusion with their more primative
denotation.

* Metadata
Inside of every OidaDB file there exist 1 section consisting of what
is known as Metadata. This metadata is for the most part calculated
when the database is [[./odb_create][created]] and remains static. Though there are some
parts of the metadata that can/will change over time.

Everytime a database is opened, its Metadata is scanned for
validity. Metadata includes details about the database's (bit-wise)
architecture, version, and page sizes.
