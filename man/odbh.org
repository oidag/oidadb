#+TITLE: odbh - The OidaDB Handle
* TODO Intro, Lifecycle
* Threading -> Volatility
Unlike odb_* functions which disclaim, a general definition of
threading has been specified in odb_handle's threading chapter. To
restate: all of these functions are to be executed on the same thread
that had loaded the handle via odb_handle.

So instead, we will be focusing on these functions Volatility... that
is how this function may interact with other concurrently executing
handles. Ie., we will discuss the volatility in the event where Handle
A is writing and Handle B is reading: will Handle B's results be
effected by Handle A?
